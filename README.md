experiment 5 

aim: greatest number, nested greatest number, calculator, switch case 

theory: we learnt how to find the greatest number through if else statements, and even through nested if. We learnt how to use switch cases. 
if else is a conditional statement used when there are conditions, for example if a number is greater than the other or if the user chooses one thing over another. 
Nested if else is a part of those conditional statements however theyre one inside another to reduce the length of the code. It can be a bit complicated to understand though. 
The switch expression is evaluated once and the value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. if there is a match, the associated block of code is executed

output: 
greatest number:
